## 2026-09-03 — Personalised catalogue, branding, navigation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Robust Gifting Solutions branding | Done | Sidebar, portal header, login, page title, Settings default. Demo login emails unchanged (real credentials). |
| Old colour palette | Not recoverable | `--color-*` tokens and the hardcoded greens are the same palette; no earlier palette exists in the tree and git history is unavailable. Touched components consolidated onto the tokens; no new colours invented. |
| Nested-page back crash | Fixed | Root cause was `next/image` with unconfigured host in `CompanyAvatar`, plus a total absence of error boundaries. |
| Error / not-found boundaries | Added | App root, `/crm`, `/portal`, plus `global-error`. |
| Breadcrumbs | Partial | `Breadcrumbs` + `PageHeader` components added and applied to the company detail page. Not yet rolled out to every nested route. |
| Company logo | Done | Column, bucket and storage RLS already existed; added upload/replace/remove actions and UI, and a resilient shared `CompanyAvatar`. |
| SKU unique + stable | Already correct | `products_sku_unique` exists; live data clean (23/23 distinct, 0 blank). No backfill needed. SKU changes now admin-only and audited. |
| Product visibility (all / selected / none) | Done | Reuses `products.catalogue_access` + `company_product_access`; check constraint added. |
| Client catalogue isolation | Done + tested | New `client_products` definer view; isolation proven with SQL (see changelog). |
| Admin catalogue assignment UI | Already existed | Product detail page grant/revoke + visibility mode; list shows "All Clients" / "N Clients" / "Internal Only". Role checks added to the server actions. |
| Catalogue audit trail | Done | `audit_products` + `write_catalogue_access_audit` triggers into `audit_logs`. |
| Historical data integrity | Verified by inspection | Order/quotation item RLS keys off the parent record's company, never off catalogue access. |
| Client search/filter/pagination | Done | Server-side, inside the secured view, so counts and totals cannot leak. |
| Searchable company multi-select | Partial | Assignment is one company at a time via a dropdown; no multi-select with select-all yet. |

## Known remaining gaps

- Admin catalogue assignment is one company per action; no searchable multi-select with select-all, and no inline "Catalogue updated" toast (the page revalidates instead).
- Breadcrumbs applied to the company detail page only; other nested routes still rely on the back button alone.
- `#4A235A` purple remains on quotation and product screens and is outside the token palette.
- Client shortlisting still applies only to campaign offerings, because `client_product_selections` requires `campaign_id`/`campaign_product_id`.
- Mockup “upload” is URL registration, not binary storage upload.
- Client cannot auto-update `campaigns.status` (write is internal-only); sales sees selections on the campaign page.
- Review insert is admin-only by RLS.
- No Robust Gifting Solutions video file was available for pixel-level screen audit.
- Binary file storage buckets for mockups/samples photos not wired.
